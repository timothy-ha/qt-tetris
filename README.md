# qt-tetris

**CSE 165: Project Proposal**<br/>\
**Team Members**: Aayush Koirala, Timothy Ha, and Elaine Huang<br/>
**Game: Tetris**<br/>

**Summary of what we plan to do:** <br/>
Tetris Summary of what we plan to do: Our group has chosen to do work with 2D primitives and make a Tetris game in QT. To summarize, a Tetris game is a tile-matching video game where you get points if you fill up a row with all tiles that a user randomly gets of a different shape. The game is over when tiles are stacked up to the top of the screen. 

We plan to add many features such as our unique game sounds, control the tile movement with both mouse and keyboard, and a unique scoring system where users get more points/points multiplier if they fill up multiple rows simultaneously. There will also be various game modes. For example, we will implement a game mode where the game randomly places a unique tile on the "map", and the player's goal is to recover from the mess and keep the game going as long as they can while earning points. 

These features are just the bare minimum while making the game, and we believe that we will add a lot more features as new ideas come to our mind. We plan to work together by using GitHub.

**Team member roles:**<br/>
-**Timothy Ha:** Timothy will work on dealing with tile collision, calculation of scores & times, and implementation of textures for each tiles within the game.<br/>

-**Aayush Koirala**: Aayush will deal with implementation of mouse and keyboard inputs. Aayush will also work on implementation of unique game sounds and hold section for the tiles in the game.<br/>

-**Elaine Huang:** Elaine will work on adding new game mode such as where the game randomly places a unique tile on the "map". Elaine will also work on incoming tile selection, beautifying the game window, and extensive game testing to make sure bugs are reported to other members and fixed as well.<br/>
